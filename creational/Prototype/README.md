# Prototype

**Creational design pattern.**

Prototype design pattern is used when the Object creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you have a similar object already existing.

Prototype pattern provides a mechanism to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to our needs. Prototype design pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.

### Example

``` Java

### Applicability

Use the Prototype pattern when:

* instances of a class can have only a few different combinations of state. It may be more convenient to install a corresponding number of prototypes and clone them rather than instantiating the class manually, each time with the appropriate state.
