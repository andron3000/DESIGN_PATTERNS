**Structural design pattern.**

The Facade Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in as subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

### Example

``` Java

### Applicability

Use the Facade pattern when:

* you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. 

* there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability.

* you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level.
