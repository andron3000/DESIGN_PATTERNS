# Adapter

**Structural design pattern.**

The Adapter Pattern describes how to convert an object into another object which a clients expects. This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one. Adapters allow objects to work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Adapter allows to reuse existing coding without changing it, as the adapter ensures the conversion between the different interfaces.

In comparison to a decorator pattern, **the Adapter Pattern only converts objects, while the Decorator Pattern adds new functionality to an existing object**. Therefore, the decorator does not change the existing interface.


### Example

### Applicability

Use the Facade pattern when:

* you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. 

* there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability.

* you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level.
