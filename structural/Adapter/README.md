# Adapter

**Structural design pattern.**

The Adapter Pattern describes how to convert an object into another object which a clients expects. This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one. Adapters allow objects to work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

Adapter allows to reuse existing coding without changing it, as the adapter ensures the conversion between the different interfaces.

In comparison to a decorator pattern, **the Adapter Pattern only converts objects, while the Decorator Pattern adds new functionality to an existing object**. Therefore, the decorator does not change the existing interface.


### Example

``` Java
interface Shape {
    void draw(int x, int y, int z, int j);
}

class Line {
    public void draw(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        System.out.println("Line from point A(" + x1 + ";" + y1 + "), to point B(" + x2 + ";" + y2 + ")");
    }
}

class Rectangle {
    public void draw(int x, int y, int width, int height) {
        System.out.println("Rectangle with coordinate left-down point (" + x + ";" + y + "), width: " + width
                + ", height: " + height);
    }
}

class LineAdapter implements Shape {
    private Line adaptee;

    public LineAdapter(Line line) {
        this.adaptee = line;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        adaptee.draw(x1, y1, x2, y2);
    }
}

class RectangleAdapter implements Shape {
    private Rectangle adaptee;

    public RectangleAdapter(Rectangle rectangle) {
        this.adaptee = rectangle;
    }

    @Override
    public void draw(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        int x = Math.min(x1, x2);
        int y = Math.min(y1, y2);
        int width = Math.abs(x2 - x1);
        int height = Math.abs(y2 - y1);
        adaptee.draw(x, y, width, height);
    }
}

public class AdapterDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Shape[] shapes = {new RectangleAdapter(new Rectangle()),
                          new LineAdapter(new Line())};
        int x1 = 10, y1 = 20;
        int x2 = 30, y2 = 60;
        for (Shape shape : shapes) {
            shape.draw(x1, y1, x2, y2);
        }
    }
}

### Applicability

Use the Facade pattern when:

* you want to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem. 

* there are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability.

* you want to layer your subsystems. Use a facade to define an entry point to each subsystem level.
